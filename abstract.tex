This document is authored by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC),
guided by the community input, and it will serve as a roadmap for the concluding
round of survey cadence simulations. These simulations, to be delivered during early
calendar year 2022, will inform the phase 2 survey strategy recommendation which
will define the baseline strategy for starting the Rubin Observatoryâ€™s Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST). The phase 2 SCOC recommendation will be delivered to the
Rubin Observatory Operations Director before the end of calendar year 2022.
