This document, authored by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC\footnote{For SCOC membership, please see the end of this document}) and 
reflecting community input, is work in progress. An advanced draft will be presented at the Project and Community Workshop in August, 2021. The document will be finalized before the end of calendar year 2021 and it will serve as a guide for the concluding round of survey cadence simulations. These simulations, to be delivered during early calendar year 2022, will inform the phase 2 survey strategy recommendation which will define the baseline strategy for starting the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The phase 2 SCOC recommendation will be delivered to the Rubin Observatory Operations Director before the end of calendar year 2022.
